    "Often, it can be important to find not only the \"best\" solution, but a number of solutions that are equally optimal, or close to optimal. For discrete optimization problems, this can be done using something known as an integer cut. Consider again the knapsack problem where the choice of which items to select is a discrete variable $x_i \\forall i \\in A$. Let $x_i^*$ be a particular set of $x$ values we want to remove from the feasible solution space. We define an integer cut using two sets. The first set $S_0$ contains the indices for those variables whose current solution is 0, and the second set $S_1$ consists of indices for those variables whose current solution is 1. Given these two sets, an integer cut constraint that would prevent such a solution from appearing again is defined by,\n",

    "Under appropriate assumptions, $F$ is the volumetric flowrate through the tank. The concentation of component A in the feed is $c_{Af}$, and the concentrations in the reactor are equivalent to the concentrations of each component \n",
    "flowing out of the reactor, given by $c_A$, $c_B$, $c_C$, and $c_D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reactor is too small, we will not produce sufficient quantity of B, and if the reactor is too large, much of B will be further reacted to form the undesired product C. Therefore, our goal is to solve for the reactor volume that maximizes the outlet concentration for product B.\n",
